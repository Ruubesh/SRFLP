# Single Row Facility Layout Problem

Implemented an optimized branch-and-bound algorithm to solve the Single Row Facility Layout Problem (SRFLP), a challenging combinatorial optimization problem.

Implemented parallel processing using Pythonâ€™s multiprocessing module to enhance performance by dividing permutations across multiple processors.

Loaded and preprocessed problem instances using NumPy to manage memory-efficient numerical operations.
